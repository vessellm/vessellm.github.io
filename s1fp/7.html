<h2>This is some poem.<br>By some dude<br>I don't really know what it's about, but I kinda like it</h2>
<h2>Read it if you want to. Or you can go <a href="6.html"> here,</a> but I don't recommend it.</h2>

<body>Something is there that doesn't love a wall,<br>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br>And spills the
    upper boulders in the sun;<br>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br>The work of hunters is another
    thing:<br>I have come after them and made repair<br>Where they have left not one stone on a stone<br>But they would
    have the rabbit out of hiding,<br>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br>No one has seen them made or heard
    them made,<br>But at the spring mending-time we find them there.<br>I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>And
    on a day we meet to walk the line<br>And set the wallbetween us once again.<br>We keep the wall between us as we
    go.<br>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br>And some are loaces adn some so nearly balls<br>We have to
    use a spell to make them balance:<br>'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'<br>We wear our fingers rough
    with handling them.<br>Oh, just anothe rkind of out-door game,<br>One on a side. It comes to little more:<br>There
    it is we do not need the wall:<br>He is all pine and I am apple orchard<br>My apple trees will never get
    across<br>And eat the cones under his pines I tell him<br>He only says,'Good fences make good neighbors.'<br>Spring
    is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br> If I could put a notion in his head:<p style="font-style:italic;">'Why</p>do
    they make good neighbors? Is'nt it<br>Where the cows are? But here I am with now cows.<br>Before I built a wall I'd
    ask to kno<br>what I was walling in or walling out,<br>And to whom I ws like to give offense.<br>Something there is
    that doesn't love a wall,<br>That wants it down.' I could say 'Elves' to him,<br>But it's not elves exactly, and I'd
    rather<br>He said it for himself. I see him there<br>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br>In each hand,
    like an old savage armed.<br>He moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br>Not of woods only and the shade of
    trees.<br>He will not go behind his father's saying,<br>And he likes having thought of it so well<br> He says again,
    'Good fences make good neighbors'</body>
